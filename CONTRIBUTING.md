# Contributing Guide for USTH Study Notes Emporium

## Images

All images should be captioned.

Images should preferably not exceed 625px in width. The height should be
preferably within a screen height, but for diagrams such as flowcharts,
exceeding one screen is unavoidable.

## Code styling

Header styles must be followed:

- `=` for H1
- `-` for H2
- `~` for H3
- `#` for H4

The length of the header code string should match the length of the text string
itself.

Refer to this (file)[./source/ads/introduction.rst] for syntax and spacing.
